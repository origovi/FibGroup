# FibGroup
App made for HackUPC 2021 by Laura Carrera, Oriol Gorriz and Albert Vidal. This app pretends to manage work group creation in a subject of FIB.

## Inspiration
We all have been in that situation where you start a course in your university and you are said to form laboratory or problem groups for any subject and we didn't know anyone in our class. This app pretends to help in those situations and help the creation of teams within the same subject subgroups or joining teams that have a lack of members.

## What it does
You log in with your university account and immediately you can add a certain subgroup for any subject that your university teaches and requires the formation of working groups. After adding all the subjects that you need there is a main page named "Les meves asignatures" where you can manage the creation/union of groups  for a certain subject you already added. You can also access to the list of students that have added the same subject subgroup and check for their email and some description on their profile in order to contact them if needed.

## How we built it
We used Flutter as our main Software Development Kit and supported the project with a Firebase database.

## Challenges we ran into
- Two of the three members had never used Flutter or programed for a mobile app before, so that we had some trouble staring the project and learning about how to do it.
- Synchronization, how to sync data between two users using different phones, simultaneously.
- 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Make a working app. We're really proud of making a real app that solves a real problem and on top of that, it works!
- Being able to log in with Google without entering an email or a password and permitting only the @estudiantat.upc.edu email to do it felt really good to achieve.
- Fast synchronization between users.
- Simple and efficient interface.

## What we learned
We learned about Dart language which we found really interesting and comfortable to learn and experienced a little with databases, which we really had never used at all.

## What's next for FIB Group
We plan to combine it with the Raco API in order to have all the information related to Subjects and students for a much better performance.
